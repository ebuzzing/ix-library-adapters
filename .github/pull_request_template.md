## Good practices

### Schedule a session to talk about the implementation

If the feature is complicated or imply a fundamental change, please schedule a meeting session
 with SSP members to discuss the architecture and the implementation, before doing anything
 else.

### Split your PR in smaller ones

Try to split your PR in smaller ones when possible. A good PR is a PR with a **maximum**
 of 500 updated lines,  including **both** additions and subtractions.

It will make each deploy safer and will ease the reviews.

Try to provide a clear description of what you are trying to achieve with your changes,
 as this will help understand and review your code.

### Make sure the PR build is green

Try to have a green build first before asking for a review.

### Assign SSP and label your PR as 'Ready to review'

When your pull request is ready to review, please assign the `SSP` team and add the label
 `Ready to review`.

## Teamwork for the win

If at any moment, you need help, please start by asking on our slack channel **#innov-ssp**
 or by pinging the team directly on the PR. When needed, we will find a slot to assist you
 and/or work in pair with you.

If you have a strict deadline, please inform us as soon as possible (ideally when the PR starts)
 so we can make sure your PR will be ready to release in time.
